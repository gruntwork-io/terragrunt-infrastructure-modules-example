# S3 Bucket Module

This is an example of how to use Terraform/OpenTofu to create an [S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). See the 
[root README](/README.md) for instructions on how to run this example code. 

Note: This code is meant solely as a simple demonstration of how to lay out your files and folders with 
[Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) in a way that keeps your [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)
and [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) code DRY. This is not production-ready code, so use at your own risk.
