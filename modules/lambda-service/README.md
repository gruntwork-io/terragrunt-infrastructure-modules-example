# Lambda Service Module

This is an example of how to use Terraform/OpenTofu to deploy a [Lambda function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) with an 
[HTTP (V2) API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api.html) in front of it. 
See the [root README](/README.md) for instructions on how to run this example code. 

Note: This code is meant solely as a simple demonstration of how to lay out your files and folders with 
[Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) in a way that keeps your [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)
and [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) code DRY. This is not production-ready code, so use at your own risk.
